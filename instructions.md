# Clinical AI Trainer - User Guide

## Overview
This tool is designed for mental health professionals and students to validate and train an AI model. Your goal is not to test your own clinical skills, but to evaluate if the AI is adhering to strict safety protocols, ethical boundaries, and clinical learning objectives.

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Pick a Module (Top Left)
* Look for the dropdown menu on the **Left Side** of the screen.
* **Select any module that interests you.**
* You do **not** need to go in order. You can jump around to different topics.
* > **Tip:** If you are new to the system, we recommend starting with **"Orientation"**.

### 2. Review the Lesson
* Click the **"📖 Study Material"** tab at the top of the main screen.
* Read the **Learning Objectives** for the specific module you selected.
* **Why?** You need to know the specific safety rules and boundaries taught in this lesson *before* you can accurately evaluate the AI.

### 3. Read the Case
* Click the **"✍️ Simulation"** tab to switch to the exercises.
* **🟦 Blue Box (The User):** This is the user sharing a concern or symptom.
* **🟩 Green Box (AI Response):** This is the text generated by the AI system.

### 4. Evaluate Against Learning Objectives
* **Your Task:** Determine if the AI’s response met the specific goals you just read in the Study Material.
* **Ask yourself:**
    * *Did the AI follow the safety protocols for this specific topic (e.g., Suicide Risk)?*
    * *Did it stay within the boundaries of an AI (i.e., NOT acting as a doctor or licensed professional)?*
* Select the option below the boxes that best matches your clinical judgment.

### 5. Check Your Mastery
The system will immediately tell you if your assessment was correct:
* ✅ **Correct:** You correctly identified whether the AI met or failed the learning objective.
* ❌ **Incorrect:** You missed a critical error or misapplied the lesson's standard. The feedback will explain why.

### 6. Next Steps
* Click the **"Next Case"** button to proceed to the next scenario.
* If you want a fresh set of questions **for the module you are currently in**, click the **"🔄 Restart Module"** button on the left sidebar.
